## INTRODUCTION
Have you ever wondered how space science has improved over years? Which country has most satellites? Where are these satellites? What're their uses?
The Visualization presents information about universal satellites in multi-dimensional aspects

## DATA SOURCE
- Data is obtained from [UCS Satellite Database](https://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear-weapons/space-weapons/satellite-database#.W9z4f3pKhTb)
- Detailed, massive information on every working satellite

## CONTENT SUMMARY
### LAUNCH MAP
- Choropleth
- Different filters: number of satellites of countries, number of satellites launched by countries, 

### ORBIT
- Three main orbits: LEO, MEO, GEO ; some interesting elliptical orbits
- Can be filtered by country

### INSIGHT
- Combination of several basic charts
- For example: line chart: year and number of satellites; Pie chart: percentage of number of satellites of different countries/ others


## DEV SETUP

### NODE AND NPM
- Make sure you have latest Node and npm
- Use `npm install` to install necessary packages for running the project

### D3 and JS
- For first part, geojson is used to draw the world map
- For second part, 
- For third part,

### ANGULAR
- This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.5.

### BOOTSTRAP


## DEPLOYMENT
- Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
- Deploy on USC SCF
