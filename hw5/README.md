# INF 554 Assignment for 5
## Introduction
This assignment is the proposal presentation of the visualization project by Team Kepler.


## PechaKucha Slides
Our presentation is in PechaKucha format, 15 pictures, each of which 20 seconds.

## Talking Points
### Slide 0 (Cover)
- Project title: 
- Group name: Kepler
- Member name and email: 
    - Yukang Tian, yukangti@usc.edu 
    - Yuning Zhu, zhuyunin@usc.edu
    - Chen Lou, chenlou@usc.edu

### Slide 1
Introduction
- 10 words on what our visualization is about ï¼š The Visualization presents information about universal satellites in multi-dimensional aspects.
### Slide 2
Audience
- Those who have spirit of exploring like scientists
- Those who are interested in the universe  especially satellite fans
- Those who are curious about the world

### Slide 3
Why interesting
- Everyone knows Earth is surrounded by satellites
- Almost no one knows further, like when is the first satellite launched? Which country has most of them? What are their purposes? How many of them are up there?
- It's hard to look at raw data to get information
- But it's pleasant to look at visualization talking about these information

### Slide 4
Importance and uses?
- Popularization of aerospace science
- This also easy for people to understand basic information about the satellites

### Slide 5
Data and obtain
- UCS Satellite Database
- Detailed, massive information on every satellite
- Free, online

### Slide 6
- The first chart is a Proportional Symbol Map
- How to interact with map: zoom in/out, click on country/dot.
- The map shows the satellites situation of each country and many detailed information.

### Slide 7
- The second chart is a top-down satellites orbit graph.
- How to interact with map: you can click on satellites, orbit.
- The map shows the purpose, ownership, perigee and apogee of satellites.

### Slide 8
- The third chart is a combination of several basic charts.
- How to interact with map: adjust the time bar or input specific word.
- These charts show the number of satellites of each country, purpose of satellites, type of orbit and other potential information by year or country.

### Slide 9
Design considerations
- Turn massive, unreadable data into expressive, clear visualizations
- Multi layers, those who want to know more can get more information through interaction
- Some problems we may meet.

### Slide 10
An example of comparation. Our design is:
- More dynamic
- Clearer
- More figurative

### Slide 11
Technologies we plan to use
- Javascript
- D3.js
- Angular
- Bootstrap
- HTML
- CSS
- Git

### Slide 12
Plan and Risk
- Plan
    - Process data since it contains many attributes that we won't use
    - Design based on course knowledge and on what have been done by others
    - Develop step by step, from top to bottom
    - Invite others to see our page
- Risk
    - Technique: some new techs to learn
    - Resource: Time may not be enough

### Slide 13
Deliverables include 
- A working demo 
- A video of the application on Youtube 
- Paper in the LNCS format 
- Presentation in PechaKucha format

### Slide 14
How we work together
- Meet regularly to list to-dos for next phase
- Each member takes responsibiliy for a part and completes independently
- Meet again

The team
- We are interested
- We have a great plan
- We have enough technical background
- We would devote much time

Resources
- Our computers
- Guide from Prof Luciano

### Slide 15
Timeline

- Data Explore (Sep 6 - Sep 20)
- Design (Sep 21 - Oct 4)
- Develop (Oct 5 - Nov 9)
- Close (Nov 12 - Dec 5)

## Deliverables
